  <h1>About EasyDose-API</h1>

  <h4>Sites</h4>
  <p>
    Sites are collectively all the workstations that use easydose, a single
    site may have many workstations that access a database.
  </p>

  <h4>Pharmacy Database(s)</h4>
  <p>
    Each workstation accesses a Pharmacy Database using the EasyDose client software
    according to the rules of the License. Each Pharmacy Database is uniquely identified
    by a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) which is generated when the Database
    initially contacts my.easydose.net.au.
  </p>

  <h4>Account</h4>
  <p>
    Within my.easydose.net.au accounts are established. The Pharmacy Database is linked
    to an account, each account may have only one Pharmacy Database. The license
    purchased by that account is the license that is exposed to the EasyDose
    client software.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>User</strong> = <strong>Account</strong>. These terms are ubiquitos. A
    user has an account.
  </p>

  <h4>License</h4>
  <p>
    A License is calculated from the FREE license which kicks easydose off.
    The default FREE license is <strong>easydoseFREE</strong>. Extensions to the
    License are calculated based on the products which are attached to paid invoices.
  </p>

  <h4>Invoices</h4>
  <p>
    Invoices group products together to contribute to a license. e.g. 1 x EasyDose
    OPEN product + 1 x 1 additional EasyDose workstation groups together for an Open
    EasyDose License with 2 workstations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invoices have status (they are in a state)
  <ul>
    <li>No Status (blank state)</li>
    <li>Sent</li>
    <li>Approved <em>(final state : no payment required because it was either
        paid or free)</em></li>

  </ul>

  </p>
